# EntitasTanks
Entitas port of the Unity Tanks Tutorial project


I tried to make an example Entitas project that people who are new to it could inspect and maybe find out inspiration as to how to do certain things.

It's based on Unity's Tanks Tutorial:
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/46209

Most of the relevant code is inside Assets/Entitas/Scripts

The used Prefabs can be found under Assets/Resources

If you have any questions - please join the Entitas gitter chat:
https://gitter.im/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp


Hope this project helps you!


All the models, sounds, textures etc. are taken directly from the Unity project which is included here for comparison (Assets/Complete).
